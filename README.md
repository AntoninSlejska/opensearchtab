INTRODUCTION
------------

This minimalistic Drupal module activates the 'Tab to Search' feature used in
Chrome.

The 'Tab to Search' feature is described in the article [Google Chrome – Tab to
Search](http://www.danielfuterman.com/google-chrome-tab-to-search/). How can a
website enable the 'Tab to Search' is described on the website of the Chromium
project: [Tab to Search](http://www.chromium.org/tab-to-search).

You can test the module on a test site:

 1. Visit the [test website](https://drupal.slejska.de) with Chrome.
 2. After that you should find a new search engine 'Test OTS' in 'Chrome search
    settings / Other search engines' (chrome://settings/searchEngines).
 3. Open a new tab.
 4. Write 'drupal.slejska.de test' in your Chrome address bar.

The module is published as:

 * [GitHub repository](https://github.com/AntoninSlejska/opensearchtab)
